    "In this section we'll be learning how to make plots which not only present the data, but in a way which is visualy intiutive to other scientists to grasp the key points of your data. This often means having to transform the raw data from an experiment and thinking about what information is truly relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have some familarity of Excel or other spreadsheet based graphing software, but in many instances (and computational chemistry in particular) the preset plot options are unable to achieve the right results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Jupyter notebooks for this course. These notebooks allow documentation, flexible plotting, and even automatic analysis and manipulation of data through the use of embedded python code. Most of these examples have been adapted directly from the excellent matplotlib tutorial: https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The cells in these notebooks alternate between explanation cells, and embedded executable code cells. The text in the code cells is `monospace` and higlighted by code syntex. To execute a code cell hit `shift + enter` keys and all the code will run. The notebook will also remember the results and variables of all previously run code cells (_the reset option is in the menu: `Kernel -> Restart`_).\n",
